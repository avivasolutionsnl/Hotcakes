## Contributing

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 update 1809
- Docker for Windows version >= 18.09.1
- Visual Studio 15.5.3

### Setup a development environment
- Open a console en navigate to the repository root folder.

- Build the project in Visual Studio and publish the projects to the following folders
Nyxie.Serialization --> \build\website
Sitecore.Commerce.Engine --> \build\commerce

- Build Sitecore XC Docker images according to the instructions found here: https://github.com/Sitecore/docker-images
    - Or if you have pre-built Docker images available in a registry, set the `REGISTRY` in (./env)

- Copy your Sitecore license file (license.xml) to the [](./license) folder

- Spin up the environment (make sure you are using Windows and not Linux containers):
```
PS> docker-compose up
```

To set the Docker container service names as DNS names on your host edit your `hosts` file. 
A convenient tool to automatically do this is [whales-names](https://github.com/gregolsky/whales-names).

Synchronize the development content by running Unicorn: [http://cm/unicorn.aspx?verb=sync](http://cm/unicorn.aspx?verb=sync).

Initialize your Commerce Engine and setup a Storefront according to the instructions [here](https://github.com/Sitecore/docker-images/tree/master/windows/tests/9.2.x).
> Unselect the Habitat catalog in `Commerce > Catalog Management > Catalogs` before adding a Storefront site

Fix indexes by:

- Opening the content editor
- Make sure the Habitat catalog is selected in the Commerce Control panel 
- Goto the commerce tab
- Delete Data Templates
- Update Data Templates
- Goto control panel and rebuild the `sitecore_master_index` & `sitecore_sxa_master_index`

> If you get an error saying: 'field _indexname' not found: remove files in host [](./data/solr) folder. Restart containers and populate schema.

## Known issues
- For the category related qualifications and benefits to work we need to add a custom component to the cart line when a product is added. This component adds the category path and in order to determine this path it uses the Sitecore Item API. This call to the Item API is not ideal and we should try to determine the category path without the call.

## Resources
https://sitecoresmurf.wordpress.com/2019/07/18/known-issues-limitations-and-extending-promotion-plugin-in-sitecore-commerce-9/
Out of the box, sitecore doesn't allow boolean values in Conditions.
To change this behavior we made our own version of the BuildRuleSetBlock in which we called our own SitecoreExtensions.ConvertToConditionExtended and SitecoreExtensions.ConvertToActionExtended.
